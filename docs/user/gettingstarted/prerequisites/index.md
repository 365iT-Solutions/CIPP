To get started make sure you have the following information ready;

- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP) repository.
- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP API GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API) repository.
- An active Azure Subscription.
- A GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on what you need and the minimum permissions to do this [in Microsoft's Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-azure-resource-manager?tabs=azure-cli#create-a-github-personal-access-token). You only need the "Create a GitHub Personal Access Token" section.

For the installation and maintenance, it's assumed you have some knowledge of GitHub. Using the latest version of CIPP, you do not need to execute the Secure Application Model Script beforehand. If you have your own Secure Application Model setup you'll be able to enter these keys after setup.
