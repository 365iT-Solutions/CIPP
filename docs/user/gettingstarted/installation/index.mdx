You can install CIPP two different ways, click-to-deploy and manual. When you use a hosted setup, this is all performed for you.


A click-to-deploy install is the preferred way to install CIPP using a GitHub fork of the CIPP UI and API repositories. It utilises Azure deployment templates to automate the deployment of the CIPP UI and API.

A manual install is an advanced method of installing CIPP, requiring more knowledge of Git and Azure but providing wider choice of Git hosting services and greater flexibility around deployment.

Detailed information about each of these installation methods is in the tabs below:

:::tip Installation Tips

You **must replace** the preset "Github Repository" and "Github API Repository" fields with the URL's of **your own Github forks** of the CIPP and CIPP-API repositories.

If your installation fails, you must delete the resource group and try again.

Unless you know what you're doing manual installation isn't advised, there's a lot of moving parts where one could make a mistake. You must use the manual installation instructions if you wish to host your repository in [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com).
