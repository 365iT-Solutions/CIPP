You can install CIPP two different ways, click-to-deploy and manual.  There is also an option to have it hosted by Kelvin directly.


A click-to-deploy install is the preferred way to install CIPP using a GitHub fork of the CIPP UI and API repositories. It utilises Azure deployment templates to automate the deployment of the CIPP UI and API.

A manual install is an advanced method of installing CIPP, requiring more knowledge of Git and Azure but providing wider choice of Git hosting services and greater flexibility around deployment.

Detailed information about each of these installation methods is in the tabs below:

:::tip Installation Tips

1. You **must replace** the preset "Github Repository" and "Github API Repository" fields with the URL's of **your own Github forks** of the CIPP and CIPP-API repositories 
1. You should use a **dedicated** account for your Secure Application Model application.
1. You should use a new resource group in Azure to deploy CIPP.
1. If you're redeploying CIPP, you must remove the old resource group - this isn't required if you just want to [update tokens](/docs/general/troubleshooting/#refresh-secure-application--model-tokens)!

Unless you know what you're doing manual installation isn't advised, there's a lot of moving parts where one could make a mistake. You must use the manual installation instructions if you wish to host your repository in [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com).
