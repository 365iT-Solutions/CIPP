Please read all of the instructions below before proceeding to click the "Deploy to Azure" button, to determine which option you should select.

After you have completed the prerequisites in the [Prerequisites](../prerequisites/) section, select the button below to run the automated setup. This does most of the work for you. If you don't want to use the automated installer, use the manual installation instructions.

## Deploy to an another region

Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) is global by default (it picks the data center closest to you) however some regions don't support deployment. Regions that support SWA deployment at the moment are:

- Central US
- East US 2
- East Asia
- West Europe
- West US 2

To work around this use the alternative installation button below. This deploys the Static Web App in the *Central US* region however the SWA gets served from your nearest data center anyway. The other parts of CIPP get installed in the region you choose so you shouldn't experience any latency.
