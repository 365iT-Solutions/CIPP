Configure notifications from CIPP.

CIPP provides alert notifications for Tenants and CIPP actions, sent as one combined table in an email or webhook body.

* [Tenant Alerts](../../tenantadministration/alerts) create notifications regarding changes within a tenant. See that help
page for more information on managing those alerts.
* CIPP Alerts relate to changes initiated via the CIPP platform.

## Available CIPP Alerts

- New Accounts created via CIPP
- Removed Accounts via CIPP
- New Applications added via CIPP
- New Policies added via CIPP
- New Standards added via CIPP
- Removed Standards via CIPP
- Token Refresh Events

## Sending Methods

### E-mail
Enter a single email address (example: `psmith@example.com`).  Email sends from the partner tenant Office 365 account
used to generate CIPP application keys. The account must have at least an *Exchange Online Plan 1* license assigned.

:::info Sent Items
Notification emails **do not save** to the CIPP account's *Sent Items* folder.

### Webhook

Enter a webhook url. Data is formatted based on the receiving server:

|       Service         |                       Format                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| *webhook.office.com*  | A basic HTML formatted table.                         |
| *slack.com*           | A separate markdown-formatted message for each alert. |
| *discord.com*         | A basic HTML formatted table.                         |
| All other services    | JSON array of data values.                            |
